# Trails With Friends

Trails With Friends is a web app to keep track of hikes you've completed in a social and visually pleasing way. It also allows you to compare your hiking mileage with other users of the site on a leaderboard that's featured on the home page. 

## Website

It's [live](https://trails-with-friends.netlify.app/)! We would love to have your trail additions to our database! Here's a demo of how it works on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Cy04tb8r7jY)


## Tech Stack
The back end uses Ruby on Rails as an API. The front end uses React and Redux for managing state and you can visit it [here](https://github.com/jzolo22/trails-with-friends-frontend)!


## Contributors
This app was co-built by [Jonathan Hakimian](https://github.com/jonnyhak) and [Julia Zolotarev](https://github.com/jzolo22)
